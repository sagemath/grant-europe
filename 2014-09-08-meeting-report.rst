The meeting started by collating a list of the `needs <Needs.rst>` of
the participants and the communities they represented (Sage, GAP,
Singular, Pari), and where funding could help tackle those needs. It
was felt strongly that all of these might not fit well into the H2020
call in question, and it might be better to split the effort, namely,
to simultaneously apply for the H2020 VRE grant, and for the `COST
network grant <http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/ict>`_.

Proposed COST network
---------------------

The latter shall meet "small" needs, such as funding for travel,
visits, Sage days, other meetings quite well, and allow to cover a
wider network of EU sites.

Tentatively the proposal is going to be prepared by Dima and Marco.


H2020 VRE grant application
---------------------------

It emerged that Nicolas/community vision for the proposal was hard to
match with the H2020 VRE grant call, because it was too focused on the
concrete implementation of a Virtual Research Environment, when the
call was about doing research about such environments. On the other
hand, Steve's vision of an application was much more fitting into the
call, being broader and more abstract; however the applicability of
the plan and the adequacy of the team was more questionable. We worked
out a `merge <WorkPackages.rst>`_ of the two visions.

Two important points of departure are:

- introduction of a *social* component into the project, investigating
  how the interaction within open-source collaborative development of
  mathematical software happens. The corresponding work packages are to be
  coordinated by `Ursula Martin <http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ursula.martin/>`_ (Oxford).
- "abstracting" the work packages, making them less Sage technicalities-
  centric, and more fitting into the grant call.

The consortium structure was discussed and roughly decided upon (see
below). It will be a relatively small group of sites, with more than
one active person per site, and substantial project-related activities
going. Part of the rationale for this is the significant
administrative overhead imposed on each site. Given the shift in
scope, Nicolas and Steve agreed to share the burden of the lead, with
Steve being administratively the official overall lead, while Nicolas
would focus more on leading the concrete work packages of the grant.


Further, we worked on `punchlines <PunchLines.rst>`_ for the proposal, 
a tentative title was chosen, and a draft mission statement written (see below).


Grant title
-----------

Collaborative ecosystems for mathematical research and software development

.. TODO:: improve / find acronym

Mission statement for the grant
-------------------------------

Our mission is to promote a new generation of community-developed open
source software, databases, and services adapted to the needs of
collaborative research in pure mathematics and applications

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces (virtual environments?),
deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools, component
architecture, design, and standardization of software (system?) and
databases, to links to publication, data archival and reproducibility
of experiments, development models and tools, and social aspects.

It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the dynamic
Python/Sage ecosystem and its sister European projects (GAP, Pari,
Singular, LMFDB, ...).
