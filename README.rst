European grant application around Collaborative ecosystems for mathematical research and software development
=============================================================================================================

The purpose of this project is to explore and pursue grant
applications for the ecosystem of open source computational and
database software for pure mathematics and applications (GAP, LMFDB,
Linbox, Pari/GP, Sage, Singular, ...), in order to get funding in
Europe for:

- Full time developers, students, etc working on those general purpose
  technical tasks that don't fit well in the "developed by users for
  users" model and thus can't be funded indirectly through usual
  research grants.

- Workshops (e.g. Sage Days, Pari Days, joint Sage/Singular days, ...)
  for development and training, smaller developers meetings, training
  sessions, travel, visits, ...

- Hardware and computational resources (e.g. cloud),

- Possibly: subcontracting to other projects,

- Possibly: buying teaching relief, partial funding of senior
  researchers to work on software aspects, ...

- Possibly: postdocs with e.g. strong computational or software design
  research topics,

- Fostering collaboration and symbiosis within and between software
  components and developer communities.

At this stage, we are preparing two grant applications:

- A European H2020 application for the call `EINFRA-9:
  e-Infrastructure for Virtual Research Environment
  <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2144-einfra-9-2015.html>`_,
  with a small consortium, with main focus on funding developers.

  - `Draft of proposal <H2020/proposal-www.pdf?raw=true>`_
  - `README <H2020/README.rst>`_
  - `Mailing list <https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/info/math-vre-h2020-grant-europe>`_

- A `COST network <http://www.cost.eu>`_ targeting a wider `consortium
  <Cost/consortium.tex>`_.

Time line
---------

- `8-9 September 2014: Preparatory meeting <2014-09-08-meeting.rst; report at the end>`_
- January 14th of  2015: H2020 proposal submission
- March 24th of 2015: Cost Proposal submission
- September 2015-: Tentative start of H2020 project, for four years

Join!
-----

At this point, the consortium is final for the H2020 proposal, but not
for the Cost network. If you are tentatively interested in
participating, please join the `mailing list
<https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/info/sagemath-grant-europe>`_,
and send an e-mail there with:

- Name, e-mail
- Status, institute
- trac & github account if you have them
- Whatever ideas you may have for the proposals

We will add you to the collaborators on this github project so that
you can start editing the information. In particular, check and edit
the information in the `COST consortium <Cost/consortium.tex>`_
.. and `target feature <H2020/actions.tex>`_ files.

You are welcome to explore other opportunities for grant applications,
centered for example on teaching, ...
