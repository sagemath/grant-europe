About this project
==================

The purpose of this project is to explore and pursue grant
applications for the ecosystem of open source computational and
database software for pure mathematics and applications (GAP, LMFDB,
Linbox, Pari/GP, Sage, Singular, ...), in order to get funding in
Europe for:

- Full time developers, students, etc working on those general purpose
  technical tasks that don't fit well in the "developed by users for
  users" model and thus can't be funded indirectly through usual
  research grants.

- Workshops (e.g. Sage Days, Pari Days, joint Sage/Singular days, ...)
  for development and training, smaller developers meetings, training
  sessions, travel, visits, ...

- Hardware and computational resources (e.g. cloud),

- Subcontracting to other projects,

- Buying teaching relief, partial funding of senior researchers to
  work on software aspects, ...

- Postdocs with e.g. strong computational or software design research
  topics,

- Fostering collaboration and symbiosis within and between software
  components and developer communities.

Proposal accepted
=================

`OpenDreamKit: Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit for the Advancement of
Mathematics <http://opendreamkit.org/>`_: a European H2020 application for the call `EINFRA-9: e-Infrastructure for Virtual Research Environment
<http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2144-einfra-9-2015.html>`_.

In thinking
===========

A `COST network <http://www.cost.eu>`_ targeting a large `consortium
<Cost/consortium.tex>`_ and focused on community building around open
source computational math software. This is a recurrent call from the
EU, and there is a good opportunity here. What's missing at this point
is someone to take the lead. Volunteers?

Join!
-----

If you are tentatively interested in participating, in particular for
the Cost proposal, please join the `mailing list
<https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/info/sagemath-grant-europe>`_,
and send an e-mail there with:

- Name, e-mail
- Status, institute
- trac & github account if you have them
- Whatever ideas you may have for the proposals

We will add you to the collaborators on this github project so that
you can start editing the information. In particular, check and edit
the information in the `COST consortium <Cost/consortium.tex>`_
.. and `target feature <H2020/actions.tex>`_ files.

You are welcome to explore other opportunities for grant applications,
centered for example on teaching, ...
